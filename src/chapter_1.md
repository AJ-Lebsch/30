# Hobbies and Food

## Texas is great for both

So this is all about hobbies, so that is probably just going to be video games for a while. Women are off the menu for at least now. I also enjoy spending money but as I really don't have that one. Video games it is! So I guess I did spend some cash when I first got here. There were some amazing black friday cyber monday week long deals that I fully took advantage of. Also I'm paying a dollar for two weeks of Cosole game pass ultimate. So thats pretty sweet. <br>



At the end of that, I should have enough microsoft points to get another month.... and then another. If I don't have to pay for it thats amazing! Though the games seem to be lacking some sort of sparkle. I purchased Dark Souls Trilogy and it's kicking my ass and I'm loving it. Dishonored, Outter Planets, Monster hunter... I thought I would love all of it. Don't. Boarderlands 3 is pretty kick ass. So here is a whole lot of text. Nothing to it. No pictures, italics, graphs or anything. Page of words.
