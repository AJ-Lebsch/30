#This is not California

That being said, they are as prepared as California was. Blind sided by a system that does not mean to function. The law talks about intention, spirit, not always the letter. In my case, the spirit is not designed to be lawful, willing to help, or functional. I am currently in a stable invirament that is actually made of limbo. I know what the dear reader must be thinking. How is that stable? It's complicated but it is so, by comparison. Everything is relative. <br> <br> <br> <br> 


Being around people I can trust is so helpful. I don't think someone is going to be breaking in, not anytime soon. I'm not wondering who is going to move in next week. No one at least not anyone besides me has been seen talking to themselves. Well to be honest, the talker, was most assuridly the most tame person there.
